# SQL Portfolio â€“ Kathryn Starkey

This repository showcases a variety of SQL queries Iâ€™ve written and executed while practicing with datasets.  
It demonstrates core SQL skills including filtering, joins, aggregation, subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and more.

For each example, youâ€™ll see:  
- **The business-style question/problem**  
- **The SQL query I wrote**  
- **A placeholder for the result screenshot**

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Basic Filtering & Sorting  

**Question:** Show all employees born before 1985 who are male.  
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employee_demographics
WHERE birth_date < '1985-01-01'
  AND gender = 'Male';
Result Screenshot:

Question: List employees ordered first by gender, then by age descending.

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics
ORDER BY gender, age DESC;
Result Screenshot:

ðŸ”¹ 2. Aggregations & Grouping
Question: What is the average, maximum, and minimum age of employees by gender?

sql
Copy code
SELECT gender, AVG(age), MAX(age), MIN(age), COUNT(age)
FROM employee_demographics
GROUP BY gender;
Result Screenshot:

Question: Which gender has an average age greater than 40?

sql
Copy code
SELECT gender, AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM employee_demographics
GROUP BY gender
HAVING AVG(age) > 40;
Result Screenshot:

ðŸ”¹ 3. Joins
Question: Show each employeeâ€™s age and occupation by joining demographics with salary data.

sql
Copy code
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.age, sal.occupation
FROM employee_demographics AS dem
INNER JOIN employee_salary AS sal
    ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;
Result Screenshot:

Question: List all salary records, even if the employee has no demographic data (RIGHT JOIN).

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics AS dem
RIGHT JOIN employee_salary AS sal
    ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;
Result Screenshot:

Question: Pair each employee with the next employee in the salary table (self-join).

sql
Copy code
SELECT emp1.employee_id AS emp_santa,
       emp1.first_name AS first_name_santa,
       emp2.employee_id AS emp_name,
       emp2.first_name AS first_name_emp
FROM employee_salary emp1
JOIN employee_salary emp2
    ON emp1.employee_id + 1 = emp2.employee_id;
Result Screenshot:

ðŸ”¹ 4. Set Operations
Question: Create a unified list of employees over 40 (male/female) and employees earning more than $70,000.

sql
Copy code
SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Old Man' AS Label
FROM employee_demographics
WHERE age > 40 AND gender = 'Male'
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Old Lady' AS Label
FROM employee_demographics
WHERE age > 40 AND gender = 'Female'
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Highly Paid Employee' AS Label
FROM employee_salary
WHERE salary > 70000
ORDER BY first_name, last_name;
Result Screenshot:

ðŸ”¹ 5. String & Date Functions
Question: Display each employeeâ€™s first name along with string manipulations and birth month.

sql
Copy code
SELECT first_name, 
       LEFT(first_name, 4) AS first_four_letters,
       RIGHT(first_name, 4) AS last_four_letters,
       SUBSTRING(first_name, 3, 2) AS middle_two_letters,
       birth_date,
       SUBSTRING(birth_date, 6, 2) AS birth_month
FROM employee_demographics;
Result Screenshot:

ðŸ”¹ 6. Case Statements
Question: Calculate new salaries with raises and add bonuses for Finance employees.

sql
Copy code
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary,
       CASE
           WHEN salary < 50000 THEN salary * 1.05
           WHEN salary >= 50000 THEN salary * 1.07
       END AS new_salary,
       CASE
           WHEN dept_id = 6 THEN salary * 0.10
       END AS bonus
FROM employee_salary;
Result Screenshot:

ðŸ”¹ 7. Subqueries
Question: What is the average of the maximum ages across genders?

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(max_age) 
FROM (
    SELECT gender, MAX(age) AS max_age
    FROM employee_demographics
    GROUP BY gender
) AS Agg_table;
Result Screenshot:

ðŸ”¹ 8. Window Functions
Question: Calculate a running total of salaries within each gender, ordered by employee ID.

sql
Copy code
SELECT dem.first_name, dem.last_name, gender, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY dem.employee_id) AS rolling_total
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
    ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;
Result Screenshot:

Question: Rank employees within each gender by salary (row number, rank, dense rank).

sql
Copy code
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, dem.last_name, gender, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num,
       RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_num,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank_num
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
    ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;
Result Screenshot:

ðŸ”¹ 9. CTEs
Question: Create a CTE summarizing salary statistics by gender, then query it.

sql
Copy code
WITH CTE_Example AS (
    SELECT gender, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal, MAX(salary) AS max_sal, MIN(salary) AS min_sal, COUNT(salary) AS count_sal
    FROM employee_demographics dem
    JOIN employee_salary sal
        ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
    GROUP BY gender
)
SELECT *
FROM CTE_Example;
Result Screenshot:

ðŸ”¹ 10. Temporary Tables
Question: Create a temporary table for employees earning at least $50,000, then query it.

sql
Copy code
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE salary_over_50k AS
SELECT * 
FROM employee_salary 
WHERE salary >= 50000;

SELECT *
FROM salary_over_50k;
Result Screenshot:
